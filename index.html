                <p> My name is George Brown and I am a life-long learner and student of the study of Computer Programming and Web Development. I love all of its intricacies and quirks, along with its unlimited possibilies for personal creativity. I plan on staying above all the latest technologies and languages as this skill evolves. Currently enrolled in Thinkful's Immersive Engineering Program!</p>

                <h2>Background Story</h2>
                <p>Traditionally, I am a musician and nerd at heard. Ever since a kid, I've always been intrigued with electronics and knew that I was going to do in life that dealt with handling technology. I began making music at 13, and learned how to "self record" myself at age 16. From then is when I really honed my tech skills, countlessly following forums, blogs, YouTube, in search of the best ways I could improve on my recording skills. After almost a decade, I can say that I was at a plateu, to where I started question what would be my next step, as music wasn't really cutting it out for me (I still love and make music, but the industry is very competitive), that's when I started looking into other avenues. Again, being tech savvy as kid and up into my adult years (all of my jobs I've worked up to that point,involved tech somehow, with my most recent job being "Device Repair Technician") , I stumbled upon web development. I first discovered the art of web development in early 2017. I've always had a subtle interest for computer development, whether it was game or web development, I've always found it interesting. So, when I stumbled upon some free courses on <a id="fcc" href="https://freecodecamp.com">FreeCodeCamp</a> and discovered that I could learn this on my own for free, I dove in full fledged. I started with their HTML course, and slowly began learning CSS. After making a few ideas and mockups, I shortly began to become a little more confident with HTML & CSS. I would then for the next few years, on and off code ideas and mockups for friend projects (i.e. static shopping pages), personal bio pages, etc. I am now ready to tackle everything else this skill has to provide.</p>
